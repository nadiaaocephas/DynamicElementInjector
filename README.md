# DynamicElementInjector
DynamicElementInjector is a JavaScript script that allows you to dynamically add a new element (in this case, a paragraph) to an existing container on a web page after the document has fully loaded.

This script uses the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure that the entire HTML document is fully loaded before executing the code. After this, a new paragraph (`<p>`) is created with the text content "This is a new paragraph!". This new element is added to the existing container with the identifier `container` using the `appendChild` method.
